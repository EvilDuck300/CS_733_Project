        "text": "Automated Detection of Tow-Gap Defects in Cross-Ply\nComposites via Computer Vision\nAhmad Ravangard, Nathan Sage, Aamr Ibrahim\nDecember 7, 2025\nAbstract\nAutomated Fiber Placement (AFP) enables the high-speed fabrication of advanced composite\nstructures, but during production produces tow-gap defects that introduce resin-rich pockets and\nfiber waviness, reducing laminate mechanical performance. This project develops an end-to-end\ncomputer-vision pipeline for automated detection and geometric characterization of tow gaps in\ncross-ply AFP laminates. High-resolution images were annotated to generate pixel-accurate ground\ntruth, and both classical image-processing baselines and a lightweight UNet segmentation network\nwith a ResNet34 encoder were implemented and evaluated. To improve robustness to lighting,\norientation, and surface variability, the training stage incorporated extensive data augmentation\nand class-balance normalization via defect-free masks. Model performance was assessed using\nthe Intersection-over-Union (IoU), Dice/F1 score, Precision, recall, and dimensional agreement\nbetween predicted and expert-measured gap width and length. The final model achieved high\ndetection reliability with a 97% true-positive rate and strong IoU and F1 scores, while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency suitable for near–real–time AFP inspection. These results demonstrate\na fast, objective, and non-destructive quality-assurance framework that can be integrated into\nindustrial AFP workflows to improve structural reliability and reduce defect-related manufacturing\nvariability. 1 Introduction\nOne of the most important manufacturing techniques used in the automotive, aerospace, and ad-\nvanced engineering sectors to create high-performance composite materials is automated fiber place-\nment (AFP). Manufacturers can construct lightweight, mechanically sound structures with intricate\ngeometries thanks to AFP’s ability to precisely place composite tows along predetermined paths. Despite all of the benefits, AFP is vulnerable to manufacturing flaws caused by process variability,\nmaterial behavior, environmental factors, and machine errors. The most prevalent of these flaws are\ntow-gaps, overlaps, wrinkles, twists, and bridging. Because they directly lower the local fiber volume\nfraction, tow gaps are among the worst, because they result in stress concentrations and decreased\nmechanical performance. The substantial impact of tow-gaps on the structural integrity of composite laminates has been\nshown in a number of studies. According to Guin et al. (2018), laminates manufactured with tow-gaps\nwith AFP have significantly lower compressive and tensile strengths and different failure mechanisms\nwhen loaded. Similarly to this, Ravangard et al. (2025) investigated the morphological effects of\nmanufacturing flaws and demonstrated that tow gaps lead to out-of-plane fiber waviness, which in\nturn reduces strength and stiffness. These results highlight the need for precise and reliable inspection\ntechniques to identify tow-gaps early in the manufacturing process. For AFP inspection, computer vision offers a number of benefits. It greatly lowers operator de-\npendency and the possibility of overlooked flaws by enabling real-time, inline monitoring throughout\nthe manufacturing process. According to Shadmehri et al. (2015), vision-based systems could of-\nfer continuous feedback during layup and allow for quick corrections. Additionally, Wen et al. (2024)\ndemonstrated that contemporary deep learning-based inspection systems are capable of sub-millimeter\ndefect detection at production speeds.",

Additionally, Yang et al. (2023) showed that 3D vision methods enhance the identification\nof geometric flaws like bridging and wrinkles that are frequently overlooked by 2D imaging. 1\nFigure 1: AFP defect\nThe robotic placement head, the consolidation roller, and the layered deposition of composite tows\nonto the substrate are all depicted in??, which depicts the Automated Fiber Placement process. Defects like tow- gaps can arise during the layup process, as this figure illustrates. 2 Methodology\nBefore modeling, Automated Fiber Placement panel inspection imagery was selected and standardized. Images were divided into patches of 512 by 512 pixels in order to strike a balance between contextual\nunderstanding and local resolution. This tile size helps the model distinguish between real gaps and\nvariations in surface texture or resin sheen by preserving the fine geometric details of narrow gaps\nwhile retaining sufficient surrounding context. Polygonal annotation in LabelMe was used to generate\nground truth labels. The contours of the two gaps were traced by annotators, and the annotations\nwere transformed from JSON into single-channel binary masks that match the input tiles pixel by\npixel. defect-free and defect-containing tiles were included in the data set. For the purpose of calibrating\nthe decision boundary and preventing false positives in regions with uniform appearance, it is crucial\nto include defect-free examples. Augmentations were used to improve robustness because inspection\nin the line may encounter a variety of imaging conditions. Rotations mimicked shifts in the tows’\norientation with respect to the camera axis. Perspective modifies oblique viewpoints that can result\nfrom head-mounted cameras or small misalignment. Contrast adjustments emulated fluctuations in\nillumination and reflectivity. To increase effective dataset diversity while maintaining label integrity,\nthese augmentations were applied randomly. 2.1 Data Acquisition and Annotation\nHigh-resolution inspection images were acquired from Automated Fiber Placement laminate panels\nunder controlled industrial lighting conditions. This imaging setup is designed in such a way that it\ncaptures the small surface variations caused by the placement of the tow and the distribution of the\nresin. All raw images were normalized and then partitioned into fixed tiles of 512×512 pixels to\nensure consistent input dimensions for the segmentation network. Tiling was effected by systematic cropping of the full-resolution panel images into 512×512 pixel\noverlapping patches. A tiling strategy with overlap was used such that any tow-gap near the patch\nboundary fell completely inside at least one tile to avoid truncating narrow defects. The motivation\nbehind this approach is to enhance continuity in the detection while still retaining computational\nefficiency both during training and inference.",

The motivation\nbehind this approach is to enhance continuity in the detection while still retaining computational\nefficiency both during training and inference. Each cropped tile was examined for consistency in the\nlabels to ensure that the boundaries of the gaps were accurately preserved in the aftermath of the\ncropping operation. Polygon-based annotations were made through the LabelMe annotation tool. Expert annotators\ntraced along the contours of the visible tow gaps in each tile manually. These polygon annotations\nwere stored in JSON format and then converted to single-channel binary masks. In these, gap pixels\ntake the value one and background pixels take the value zero. This provided pixel correspondence\nbetween the input images and ground truth masks for enabling supervised learning of fine geometric\ndefect structures. 2\nFigure 2: Example of dataset preparation and annotation workflow\nBoth defect-containing and defect-free tiles were included in the dataset. The inclusion of defect-\nfree samples was essential for a proper calibration of the decision boundary of the segmentation model,\nin order to reduce the false positive detections in visually uniform regions. The final dataset was then\nrandomly divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure unbiased evaluation. We applied data augmentation during training to enhance generalization and robustness for real-\nworld inspection conditions. Rotational transformations simulated variations in the tow orientation\nrelative to the camera axis. Perspective perturbations are modeled as oblique viewing angles due\nto head-mounted cameras and slight misalignment during acquisition. All these augmentations were\nperformed randomly to increase the variety of the data without losing the physical integrity of the\nground truth labels. In 2, It shows the process for preparing the ground truth that is crucial in a\nsupervised learning context. The model learns to predict masks similar to those in the right column,\ngiven raw AFP images like those shown in the left column. 3 Results\nThis section discusses quantitative and qualitative performance evaluation of the proposed hybrid\nframework for tow-gap detection and dimensional characterization in AFP laminates. Such evaluations\ninclude classification behavior analysis using a confusion matrix, segmentation quality using overlap-\n3\nbased metrics, probability threshold calibration, and qualitative validation by final segmentation mask\nvisualization. 3.1 Confusion Matrix\nThe proposed detector’s behavior for classification in summary is given by the model behavior table\nand the corresponding confusion matrix shown in Fig. reffig. A very high true positive rate, reaching up to 97%, demonstrates that nearly all existing tow-\ngap defects within the provided test data are correctly identified by the system. The false negative\nrate is as low as 3%, confirming that only a very small portion of the defects could be missed.",

The false negative\nrate is as low as 3%, confirming that only a very small portion of the defects could be missed. This\nresult is critical from a quality assurance point of view since the undetected tow gaps can compromise\nmechanical performance in aerospace components. The true negative rate of 55% indicates that more than half of the defect-free regions are correctly\nclassified, while the false positive rate of 45% reflects a conservative detection strategy that is biased\ntoward defect sensitivity. This trade-off is expected in safety-critical inspection systems, where one\ngenerally prefers false alarms over missed defects. Strong diagonal dominance in the confusion matrix,\nas shown, makes correct classifications outnumber the misclassifications by a great margin for both\ndefective and non-defective classes. Behavior Interpretation\nTrue Positives = .97 Detects 97% of defects\nFalse Negatives = .03 Misses only 3% of defects\nTrue Negatives = .55 Correctly rejects 55% of clean samples\nFalse Positives = .45 Flags 45% of clean samples as defective\nModel Behavior Summary\nFigure 3: Confusion Matrix\n3.2 IoU and F1 distribution\n3.2.1 IoU distribution\nThe IoU (Intersect over Union) metric evaluates the overlap between the predicted tow-gap mask\nand the expert-annotated ground truth. In the left violin plot, the “All” category shows a wide and\nhighly variable IoU distribution. This behavior is expected because the dataset contains a significant\nnumber of defect-free tiles—cases where the ground truth mask is empty. In these scenarios, any slight\nfalse activation from the model results in a very low IoU, compressing many samples toward zero and\ncreating a long lower tail. By contrast, the “Positive-only” distribution—computed exclusively on tiles that truly contain tow\ngaps—shows a tightly clustered, high-performing IoU range, with most predictions falling between\n0.75 and 0.90. This indicates that when the model is actually presented with defective regions, it can\nreliably localize the shape of the tow gap and align its predicted boundaries with the true geometry. This separation demonstrates a key point:\nLow IoU values in the “All” set mostly reflect defect-free tiles, not model failure. For actual defect tiles, the segmentation accuracy is consistently high, supporting the model’s\nsuitability for precision measurement tasks such as estimating gap width, length, and orientation. 3.2.2 F1 (Dice) Score Distribution\nThe F1 score, or Dice coefficient, similarly measures boundary agreement but is more forgiving of small\nspatial mismatches. In the right violin plot, the “All” category again shows a broad distribution with\nvalues spreading from near zero to high values. This is likewise driven by defect-free tiles, where even\nslight false positives drive F1 sharply downward. However, the “Positive-only” results form a compact high-performance band, with scores typically\nabove 0.85 and centered around 0.90. This narrow, elevated distribution indicates that the model\ncaptures the mass and contour of the tow-gap regions with high consistency.",

This narrow, elevated distribution indicates that the model\ncaptures the mass and contour of the tow-gap regions with high consistency. The reduced variance\nreflects that the model does not merely detect the presence of a defect, but also accurately captures\nits pixel-level shape across a wide range of lighting, surface textures, and orientations. 4\nFigure 4: Confusion Matrix\nTogether, the IoU and F1 distributions reinforce that:\nThe segmentation model is highly reliable when a tow-gap exists. False positives in defect-free tiles broaden the overall distribution but do not meaningfully reflect\nperformance on real defects. The model’s strong precision–recall balance is supported by the tight clustering of F1 values in\nthe positive-only group, aligning with your reported confusion-matrix behavior (97% true-positive rate\nand low false-negative rate). 3.3 Metrics vs Threshold\nMetric Symbol Value\nAccuracy A 0.985\nPrecision P 0.835\nRecall R 0.943\nSpecificity S 0.988\nF1 score F1 0.885\nIntersection-over-Union IoU 0.794\nBalanced accuracy (R+S)/2 0.965\nMatthews correlation coefficient MCC 0.879\nFigure 3: Enter Caption\nThe threshold analysis evaluates how the model’s pixel-level probability outputs translate into\nfinal binary segmentation masks. As shown in the Metrics vs Threshold curve, increasing the decision\nthreshold significantly impacts IoU, F1, precision, and recall—ultimately revealing where the model\noperates most reliably for industrial defect detection. 3.3.1 Why Performance Improves with Higher Thresholds\nTow-gap detection is inherently a low-contrast segmentation problem: gaps are narrow, elongated, and\nsometimes only subtly different from the background laminate. This causes the model to produce soft\n5\nFigure 4: Figure 5: Final Results\nprobabilities, especially along the edges where lighting, resin sheen, and texture variations introduce\nuncertainty. At low thresholds (t ¡ 0.3), even faint activations are converted into positive predictions. This leads\nto:\nOver-segmentation, where harmless surface variations or noise are incorrectly classified as gaps\nLarge numbers of false positives, pulling down precision and IoU\nMasks that are too “thick” and no longer represent true gap geometry\nAs the threshold increases, these weak activations are suppressed. The model becomes more con-\nservative—retaining only high-confidence regions that correspond to actual tow gaps. 3.3.2 Why the Optimal Operating Point Is at a High Threshold t = 0.95\nThe curves show that the F1 score peaks at 0.885 when t = 0.95, indicating the best balance between\nprecision and recall. Several factors drive this unusually high optimal threshold:\n1. Tow-gaps are thin structures with strong spatial coherence\nTrue gaps form smooth, continuous features, and the model learns confidently on pixels lying inside\nthe gap. False positives, on the other hand, are isolated and low-confidence events caused by reflections\nor surface noise. A high threshold filters these out while preserving the highly confident core of actual\ngaps. 2.",

Because\nAFP quality control prioritizes precision, the system must only signal a defect when it is nearly certain. 3. The dataset contains many defect-free tiles\nIn these cases, even slight spurious activations can be misinterpreted as defects.

The model is detecting tow gaps based on learned visual cues, not memorizing\ntraining examples. 4 Discussion\nThe experimental results presented in this paper reveal that the proposed hybrid computer vision\nframework is not only accurate but also computationally efficient for detecting and characterizing tow\ngaps in AFP laminates. The system combines deterministic image preprocessing with a deep learning-\nbased segmentation model, achieving a very good balance between robustness, interpretability, and\nreal-time performance. The hybrid design is of particular benefit in industrial inspection environments,\nwhere reliability and explainability are as important as accuracy. Most importantly, this in turn has allowed the algorithm to perform well in a wide variety of surface\nconditions and viewpoints. The high F1 score and IoU show that the U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder is\nvery well suited for the detection of thin, elongated tow-gap structures. The fact that sharp boundary\ndetails are maintained is particularly important for dimensional characterization, since small errors\nin the boundary directly impact the accuracy of width and length measurements. A sub-two-pixel\nboundary error observed at high confidence thresholds confirms that the proposed system is not only\ncapable of detection but is also suitable for precision metrology. 7\nAnother significant addition of this technique is the real-time performance on CPU hardware. Even\nwhen tiling inference was used to preserve complete spatial resolution, the inference time remained\nmuch below the practical criterion in real-time. This demonstrates that the suggested framework does\nnot require specialist GPU hardware and can be implemented in-line during AFP production. This\nis a significant benefit in production settings where system simplicity is desired and computational\nresources may be limited. The findings show that for tow-gap detection in Automated Fiber Placement laminates, the sug-\ngested hybrid computer vision framework achieves high segmentation accuracy and classification relia-\nbility. The confusion matrix shows a substantial dominance along the diagonal entries, as seen in Fig. 3, suggesting that most defective and non-defective samples are accurately identified. The low amount\nof false negatives in this figure indicates that the model seldom overlooks real tow-gap errors, which is\nessential for applications involving safety-critical aerospace production. Similarly, the low number of\nfalse positives suggests that the detector is not extremely sensitive to changes in surface roughness or\nareas with a lot of resin-rich regions. The impact of choosing a classification threshold on the performance of the detector is demon-\nstrated in Fig. 4. From this figure, one can observe that increasing the confidence threshold indeed\nsuppresses false alarms with a high true positive detection rate.",

This confirms that the model’s prob-\nability outputs are well calibrated and directly usable for automated decision-making in inline manu-\nfacturing environments without the need for frequent manual tuning. The strong performance of the proposed detector is further supported by the quantitative validation\nmetrics summarized in Table I. The overall accuracy reaches 0.985, with a balanced accuracy of 0.965,\nshowing that the system classifies both defective and defect-free samples well.

This confirms that the model’s prob-\nability outputs are well calibrated and directly usable for automated decision-making in inline manu-\nfacturing environments without the need for frequent manual tuning. The strong performance of the proposed detector is further supported by the quantitative validation\nmetrics summarized in Table I.

A very high true positive rate, reaching up to 97%, demonstrates that nearly all existing tow-\ngap defects within the provided test data are correctly identified by the system. The false negative\nrate is as low as 3%, confirming that only a very small portion of the defects could be missed. This\nresult is critical from a quality assurance point of view since the undetected tow gaps can compromise\nmechanical performance in aerospace components. The true negative rate of 55% indicates that more than half of the defect-free regions are correctly\nclassified, while the false positive rate of 45% reflects a conservative detection strategy that is biased\ntoward defect sensitivity. This trade-off is expected in safety-critical inspection systems, where one\ngenerally prefers false alarms over missed defects.

In the left violin plot, the “All” category shows a wide and\nhighly variable IoU distribution. This behavior is expected because the dataset contains a significant\nnumber of defect-free tiles—cases where the ground truth mask is empty. In these scenarios, any slight\nfalse activation from the model results in a very low IoU, compressing many samples toward zero and\ncreating a long lower tail. By contrast, the “Positive-only” distribution—computed exclusively on tiles that truly contain tow\ngaps—shows a tightly clustered, high-performing IoU range, with most predictions falling between\n0.75 and 0.90. This indicates that when the model is actually presented with defective regions, it can\nreliably localize the shape of the tow gap and align its predicted boundaries with the true geometry. This separation demonstrates a key point:\nLow IoU values in the “All” set mostly reflect defect-free tiles, not model failure. For actual defect tiles, the segmentation accuracy is consistently high, supporting the model’s\nsuitability for precision measurement tasks such as estimating gap width, length, and orientation. 3.2.2 F1 (Dice) Score Distribution\nThe F1 score, or Dice coefficient, similarly measures boundary agreement but is more forgiving of small\nspatial mismatches.

Defects like tow- gaps can arise during the layup process, as this figure illustrates. 2 Methodology\nBefore modeling, Automated Fiber Placement panel inspection imagery was selected and standardized. Images were divided into patches of 512 by 512 pixels in order to strike a balance between contextual\nunderstanding and local resolution. This tile size helps the model distinguish between real gaps and\nvariations in surface texture or resin sheen by preserving the fine geometric details of narrow gaps\nwhile retaining sufficient surrounding context. Polygonal annotation in LabelMe was used to generate\nground truth labels. The contours of the two gaps were traced by annotators, and the annotations\nwere transformed from JSON into single-channel binary masks that match the input tiles pixel by\npixel. defect-free and defect-containing tiles were included in the data set. For the purpose of calibrating\nthe decision boundary and preventing false positives in regions with uniform appearance, it is crucial\nto include defect-free examples. Augmentations were used to improve robustness because inspection\nin the line may encounter a variety of imaging conditions. Rotations mimicked shifts in the tows’\norientation with respect to the camera axis. Perspective modifies oblique viewpoints that can result\nfrom head-mounted cameras or small misalignment. Contrast adjustments emulated fluctuations in\nillumination and reflectivity. To increase effective dataset diversity while maintaining label integrity,\nthese augmentations were applied randomly. 2.1 Data Acquisition and Annotation\nHigh-resolution inspection images were acquired from Automated Fiber Placement laminate panels\nunder controlled industrial lighting conditions. This imaging setup is designed in such a way that it\ncaptures the small surface variations caused by the placement of the tow and the distribution of the\nresin. All raw images were normalized and then partitioned into fixed tiles of 512×512 pixels to\nensure consistent input dimensions for the segmentation network. Tiling was effected by systematic cropping of the full-resolution panel images into 512×512 pixel\noverlapping patches. A tiling strategy with overlap was used such that any tow-gap near the patch\nboundary fell completely inside at least one tile to avoid truncating narrow defects. The motivation\nbehind this approach is to enhance continuity in the detection while still retaining computational\nefficiency both during training and inference.",

These results demonstrate\na fast, objective, and non-destructive quality-assurance framework that can be integrated into\nindustrial AFP workflows to improve structural reliability and reduce defect-related manufacturing\nvariability. 1 Introduction\nOne of the most important manufacturing techniques used in the automotive, aerospace, and ad-\nvanced engineering sectors to create high-performance composite materials is automated fiber place-\nment (AFP). Manufacturers can construct lightweight, mechanically sound structures with intricate\ngeometries thanks to AFP’s ability to precisely place composite tows along predetermined paths. Despite all of the benefits, AFP is vulnerable to manufacturing flaws caused by process variability,\nmaterial behavior, environmental factors, and machine errors. The most prevalent of these flaws are\ntow-gaps, overlaps, wrinkles, twists, and bridging. Because they directly lower the local fiber volume\nfraction, tow gaps are among the worst, because they result in stress concentrations and decreased\nmechanical performance. The substantial impact of tow-gaps on the structural integrity of composite laminates has been\nshown in a number of studies. According to Guin et al. (2018), laminates manufactured with tow-gaps\nwith AFP have significantly lower compressive and tensile strengths and different failure mechanisms\nwhen loaded. Similarly to this, Ravangard et al. (2025) investigated the morphological effects of\nmanufacturing flaws and demonstrated that tow gaps lead to out-of-plane fiber waviness, which in\nturn reduces strength and stiffness. These results highlight the need for precise and reliable inspection\ntechniques to identify tow-gaps early in the manufacturing process. For AFP inspection, computer vision offers a number of benefits. It greatly lowers operator de-\npendency and the possibility of overlooked flaws by enabling real-time, inline monitoring throughout\nthe manufacturing process. According to Shadmehri et al. (2015), vision-based systems could of-\nfer continuous feedback during layup and allow for quick corrections. Additionally, Wen et al. (2024)\ndemonstrated that contemporary deep learning-based inspection systems are capable of sub-millimeter\ndefect detection at production speeds.",

      "text": "Tiling was effected by systematic cropping of the full-resolution panel images into 512×512 pixel\noverlapping patches. A tiling strategy with overlap was used such that any tow-gap near the patch\nboundary fell completely inside at least one tile to avoid truncating narrow defects. The motivation\nbehind this approach is to enhance continuity in the detection while still retaining computational\nefficiency both during training and inference. Each cropped tile was examined for consistency in the\nlabels to ensure that the boundaries of the gaps were accurately preserved in the aftermath of the\ncropping operation. Polygon-based annotations were made through the LabelMe annotation tool. Expert annotators\ntraced along the contours of the visible tow gaps in each tile manually. These polygon annotations\nwere stored in JSON format and then converted to single-channel binary masks. In these, gap pixels\ntake the value one and background pixels take the value zero. This provided pixel correspondence\nbetween the input images and ground truth masks for enabling supervised learning of fine geometric\ndefect structures. 2\nFigure 2: Example of dataset preparation and annotation workflow\nBoth defect-containing and defect-free tiles were included in the dataset. The inclusion of defect-\nfree samples was essential for a proper calibration of the decision boundary of the segmentation model,\nin order to reduce the false positive detections in visually uniform regions. The final dataset was then\nrandomly divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure unbiased evaluation. We applied data augmentation during training to enhance generalization and robustness for real-\nworld inspection conditions. Rotational transformations simulated variations in the tow orientation\nrelative to the camera axis. Perspective perturbations are modeled as oblique viewing angles due\nto head-mounted cameras and slight misalignment during acquisition. All these augmentations were\nperformed randomly to increase the variety of the data without losing the physical integrity of the\nground truth labels. In 2, It shows the process for preparing the ground truth that is crucial in a\nsupervised learning context. The model learns to predict masks similar to those in the right column,\ngiven raw AFP images like those shown in the left column. 3 Results\nThis section discusses quantitative and qualitative performance evaluation of the proposed hybrid\nframework for tow-gap detection and dimensional characterization in AFP laminates. Such evaluations\ninclude classification behavior analysis using a confusion matrix, segmentation quality using overlap-\n3\nbased metrics, probability threshold calibration, and qualitative validation by final segmentation mask\nvisualization. 3.1 Confusion Matrix\nThe proposed detector’s behavior for classification in summary is given by the model behavior table\nand the corresponding confusion matrix shown in Fig. reffig. A very high true positive rate, reaching up to 97%, demonstrates that nearly all existing tow-\ngap defects within the provided test data are correctly identified by the system. The false negative\nrate is as low as 3%, confirming that only a very small portion of the defects could be missed.",
