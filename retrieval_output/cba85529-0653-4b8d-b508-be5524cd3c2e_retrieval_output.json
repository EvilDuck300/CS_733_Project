Manufacturers can construct lightweight, mechanically sound structures with intricate\ngeometries thanks to AFP’s ability to precisely place composite tows along predetermined paths. Despite all of the benefits, AFP is vulnerable to manufacturing flaws caused by process variability,\nmaterial behavior, environmental factors, and machine errors. The most prevalent of these flaws are\ntow-gaps, overlaps, wrinkles, twists, and bridging. Because they directly lower the local fiber volume\nfraction, tow gaps are among the worst, because they result in stress concentrations and decreased\nmechanical performance. The substantial impact of tow-gaps on the structural integrity of composite laminates has been\nshowninanumberofstudies. AccordingtoGuinetal. (2018),laminatesmanufacturedwithtow-gaps\nwith AFP have significantly lower compressive and tensile strengths and different failure mechanisms\nwhen loaded. Similarly to this, Ravangard et al. (2025) investigated the morphological effects of\nmanufacturing flaws and demonstrated that tow gaps lead to out-of-plane fiber waviness, which in\nturnreducesstrengthandstiffness. Theseresultshighlighttheneedforpreciseandreliableinspection\ntechniques to identify tow-gaps early in the manufacturing process. For AFP inspection, computer vision offers a number of benefits. It greatly lowers operator de-\npendency and the possibility of overlooked flaws by enabling real-time, inline monitoring throughout\nthe manufacturing process. According to Shadmehri et al. (2015), vision-based systems could of-\nfer continuous feedback during layup and allow for quick corrections. Additionally, Wen et al.

Images were divided into patches of 512 by 512 pixels in order to strike a balance between contextual\nunderstanding and local resolution. This tile size helps the model distinguish between real gaps and\nvariations in surface texture or resin sheen by preserving the fine geometric details of narrow gaps\nwhile retaining sufficient surrounding context. Polygonal annotation in LabelMe was used to generate\nground truth labels. The contours of the two gaps were traced by annotators, and the annotations\nwere transformed from JSON into single-channel binary masks that match the input tiles pixel by\npixel. defect-free and defect-containing tiles were included in the data set. For the purpose of calibrating\nthe decision boundary and preventing false positives in regions with uniform appearance, it is crucial\nto include defect-free examples. Augmentations were used to improve robustness because inspection\nin the line may encounter a variety of imaging conditions. Rotations mimicked shifts in the tows’\norientation with respect to the camera axis. Perspective modifies oblique viewpoints that can result\nfrom head-mounted cameras or small misalignment. Contrast adjustments emulated fluctuations in\nillumination and reflectivity. To increase effective dataset diversity while maintaining label integrity,\nthese augmentations were applied randomly. 2.1 Data Acquisition and Annotation\nHigh-resolution inspection images were acquired from Automated Fiber Placement laminate panels\nunder controlled industrial lighting conditions. This imaging setup is designed in such a way that it\ncaptures the small surface variations caused by the placement of the tow and the distribution of the\nresin. All raw images were normalized and then partitioned into fixed tiles of 512 × 512 pixels to\nensure consistent input dimensions for the segmentation network. Tiling was effected by systematic cropping of the full-resolution panel images into 512 × 512 pixel\noverlapping patches. A tiling strategy with overlap was used such that any tow-gap near the patch\nboundary fell completely inside at least one tile to avoid truncating narrow defects. The motivation\nbehind this approach is to enhance continuity in the detection while still retaining computational\nefficiency both during training and inference. Each cropped tile was examined for consistency in the\nlabels to ensure that the boundaries of the gaps were accurately preserved in the aftermath of the\ncropping operation. Polygon-based annotations were made through the LabelMe annotation tool. Expert annotators\ntraced along the contours of the visible tow gaps in each tile manually. These polygon annotations\nwere stored in JSON format and then converted to single-channel binary masks. In these, gap pixels\ntake the value one and background pixels take the value zero. This provided pixel correspondence\nbetween the input images and ground truth masks for enabling supervised learning of fine geometric\ndefect structures. 2\nFigure 2: Example of dataset preparation and annotation workflow\nBoth defect-containing and defect-free tiles were included in the dataset.

The final dataset was then\nrandomly divided into training, validation, and test sets to ensure unbiased evaluation. We applied data augmentation during training to enhance generalization and robustness for real-\nworld inspection conditions. Rotational transformations simulated variations in the tow orientation\nrelative to the camera axis. Perspective perturbations are modeled as oblique viewing angles due\nto head-mounted cameras and slight misalignment during acquisition. All these augmentations were\nperformed randomly to increase the variety of the data without losing the physical integrity of the\nground truth labels.

Suchevaluations\ninclude classification behavior analysis using a confusion matrix, segmentation quality using overlap-\n3\nbasedmetrics,probabilitythresholdcalibration,andqualitativevalidationbyfinalsegmentationmask\nvisualization. 3.1 Confusion Matrix\nThe proposed detector’s behavior for classification in summary is given by the model behavior table\nand the corresponding confusion matrix shown in Fig. reffig. A very high true positive rate, reaching up to 97%, demonstrates that nearly all existing tow-\ngap defects within the provided test data are correctly identified by the system. The false negative\nrate is as low as 3%, confirming that only a very small portion of the defects could be missed. This\nresult is critical from a quality assurance point of view since the undetected tow gaps can compromise\nmechanical performance in aerospace components. The true negative rate of 55% indicates that more than half of the defect-free regions are correctly\nclassified, while the false positive rate of 45% reflects a conservative detection strategy that is biased\ntoward defect sensitivity. This trade-off is expected in safety-critical inspection systems, where one\ngenerallyprefersfalsealarmsovermisseddefects. Strongdiagonaldominanceintheconfusionmatrix,\nas shown, makes correct classifications outnumber the misclassifications by a great margin for both\ndefective and non-defective classes.

This behavior is expected because the dataset contains a significant\nnumberofdefect-freetiles—caseswherethegroundtruthmaskisempty. Inthesescenarios,anyslight\nfalse activation from the model results in a very low IoU, compressing many samples toward zero and\ncreating a long lower tail. Bycontrast,the“Positive-only”distribution—computedexclusivelyontilesthattrulycontaintow\ngaps—shows a tightly clustered, high-performing IoU range, with most predictions falling between\n0.75 and 0.90. This indicates that when the model is actually presented with defective regions, it can\nreliably localize the shape of the tow gap and align its predicted boundaries with the true geometry. This separation demonstrates a key point:\nLow IoU values in the “All” set mostly reflect defect-free tiles, not model failure. For actual defect tiles, the segmentation accuracy is consistently high, supporting the model’s\nsuitability for precision measurement tasks such as estimating gap width, length, and orientation. 3.2.2 F1 (Dice) Score Distribution\nTheF1score,orDicecoefficient,similarlymeasuresboundaryagreementbutismoreforgivingofsmall\nspatial mismatches. In the right violin plot, the “All” category again shows a broad distribution with\nvalues spreading from near zero to high values. This is likewise driven by defect-free tiles, where even\nslight false positives drive F1 sharply downward. However, the “Positive-only” results form a compact high-performance band, with scores typically\nabove 0.85 and centered around 0.90. This narrow, elevated distribution indicates that the model\ncaptures the mass and contour of the tow-gap regions with high consistency. The reduced variance\nreflects that the model does not merely detect the presence of a defect, but also accurately captures\nits pixel-level shape across a wide range of lighting, surface textures, and orientations. 4\nFigure 4: Confusion Matrix\nTogether, the IoU and F1 distributions reinforce that:\nThe segmentation model is highly reliable when a tow-gap exists. False positives in defect-free tiles broaden the overall distribution but do not meaningfully reflect\nperformance on real defects.

Thelowamount\nof false negatives in this figure indicates that the model seldom overlooks real tow-gap errors, which is\nessential for applications involving safety-critical aerospace production. Similarly, the low number of\nfalse positives suggests that the detector is not extremely sensitive to changes in surface roughness or\nareas with a lot of resin-rich regions. The impact of choosing a classification threshold on the performance of the detector is demon-\nstrated in Fig. 4. From this figure, one can observe that increasing the confidence threshold indeed\nsuppresses false alarms with a high true positive detection rate. Thus, an optimal operating threshold\nwas chosen to be\ntau = 0.95 since it offers a good sensitivity-specificity tradeoff.

With high recall of\n0.943, the vast majority of true tow-gap defects are detected, supported by the strong specificity of\n0.988, which confirms that false positives are effectively suppressed. Strong segmentation agreement,\nverified by expert annotation, is demonstrated with an F1 score of 0.885 and IoU value of 0.794. In addition, the MCC reaches a high value of 0.879, demonstrating robust performance even under\nclass-imbalanced conditions. From a manufacturing perspective, real-time detection and measurement of tow gaps allow for\ndirect integration into inline quality control workflows. By offering geometry-aware measurements\nlike gap width, length, and orientation, the system stands in support of targeted rework, automated\nacceptance testing, and process monitoring over the long term.

This separation demonstrates a key point:\nLow IoU values in the “All” set mostly reflect defect-free tiles, not model failure.

Images were divided into patches of 512 by 512 pixels in order to strike a balance between contextual\nunderstanding and local resolution. This tile size helps the model distinguish between real gaps and\nvariations in surface texture or resin sheen by preserving the fine geometric details of narrow gaps\nwhile retaining sufficient surrounding context. Polygonal annotation in LabelMe was used to generate\nground truth labels. The contours of the two gaps were traced by annotators, and the annotations\nwere transformed from JSON into single-channel binary masks that match the input tiles pixel by\npixel. defect-free and defect-containing tiles were included in the data set. For the purpose of calibrating\nthe decision boundary and preventing false positives in regions with uniform appearance, it is crucial\nto include defect-free examples. Augmentations were used to improve robustness because inspection\nin the line may encounter a variety of imaging conditions. Rotations mimicked shifts in the tows’\norientation with respect to the camera axis. Perspective modifies oblique viewpoints that can result\nfrom head-mounted cameras or small misalignment. Contrast adjustments emulated fluctuations in\nillumination and reflectivity. To increase effective dataset diversity while maintaining label integrity,\nthese augmentations were applied randomly. 2.1 Data Acquisition and Annotation\nHigh-resolution inspection images were acquired from Automated Fiber Placement laminate panels\nunder controlled industrial lighting conditions. This imaging setup is designed in such a way that it\ncaptures the small surface variations caused by the placement of the tow and the distribution of the\nresin. All raw images were normalized and then partitioned into fixed tiles of 512 × 512 pixels to\nensure consistent input dimensions for the segmentation network. Tiling was effected by systematic cropping of the full-resolution panel images into 512 × 512 pixel\noverlapping patches. A tiling strategy with overlap was used such that any tow-gap near the patch\nboundary fell completely inside at least one tile to avoid truncating narrow defects. The motivation\nbehind this approach is to enhance continuity in the detection while still retaining computational\nefficiency both during training and inference. Each cropped tile was examined for consistency in the\nlabels to ensure that the boundaries of the gaps were accurately preserved in the aftermath of the\ncropping operation. Polygon-based annotations were made through the LabelMe annotation tool. Expert annotators\ntraced along the contours of the visible tow gaps in each tile manually. These polygon annotations\nwere stored in JSON format and then converted to single-channel binary masks. In these, gap pixels\ntake the value one and background pixels take the value zero. This provided pixel correspondence\nbetween the input images and ground truth masks for enabling supervised learning of fine geometric\ndefect structures. 2\nFigure 2: Example of dataset preparation and annotation workflow\nBoth defect-containing and defect-free tiles were included in the dataset.

The confusion matrix shows a substantial dominance along the diagonal entries, as seen in Fig. 3,suggestingthatmostdefectiveandnon-defectivesamplesareaccuratelyidentified. Thelowamount\nof false negatives in this figure indicates that the model seldom overlooks real tow-gap errors, which is\nessential for applications involving safety-critical aerospace production. Similarly, the low number of\nfalse positives suggests that the detector is not extremely sensitive to changes in surface roughness or\nareas with a lot of resin-rich regions. The impact of choosing a classification threshold on the performance of the detector is demon-\nstrated in Fig. 4. From this figure, one can observe that increasing the confidence threshold indeed\nsuppresses false alarms with a high true positive detection rate. Thus, an optimal operating threshold\nwas chosen to be\ntau = 0.95 since it offers a good sensitivity-specificity tradeoff. This confirms that the model’s prob-\nability outputs are well calibrated and directly usable for automated decision-making in inline manu-\nfacturing environments without the need for frequent manual tuning.

With high recall of\n0.943, the vast majority of true tow-gap defects are detected, supported by the strong specificity of\n0.988, which confirms that false positives are effectively suppressed. Strong segmentation agreement,\nverified by expert annotation, is demonstrated with an F1 score of 0.885 and IoU value of 0.794. In addition, the MCC reaches a high value of 0.879, demonstrating robust performance even under\nclass-imbalanced conditions. From a manufacturing perspective, real-time detection and measurement of tow gaps allow for\ndirect integration into inline quality control workflows. By offering geometry-aware measurements\nlike gap width, length, and orientation, the system stands in support of targeted rework, automated\nacceptance testing, and process monitoring over the long term. This shifts the examination from a\nsubjective,operator-dependentprocesstoarepeatable,data-drivenqualityassurancestrategy. Indeed,\nsuch capability is much in demand in aerospace manufacturing, where defects even of small size may\nhave far-reaching structural consequences. Despite these strong results, several limitations remain. The dataset currently is not fully rep-\nresentative of extreme industrial conditions involving severe glare, shadowing, and very low-contrast\nmaterials. Results showed an improved robustness through data augmentation; however, further val-\nidation with larger and more varied production datasets is necessary. In addition, the work in this\npaper is confined to the framework of tow-gap defects and has yet to include other AFP defects-\nwrinkles, bridging, twists, splices, and foreign object debris. Future work will cover the extension of\nthe model for multi-defect classification and the integration of three-dimensional sensing modalities,\nsuch as structured light or optical coherence tomography, towards enabling detection of out-of-plane\nand subsurface defects. 5 Conclusion\nThisworkpresentedarobust,end-to-endcomputer-visionframeworkfortheautomateddetectionand\ngeometric characterization of tow-gap defects in cross-ply AFP laminates.",

A very high true positive rate, reaching up to 97%, demonstrates that nearly all existing tow-\ngap defects within the provided test data are correctly identified by the system. The false negative\nrate is as low as 3%, confirming that only a very small portion of the defects could be missed. This\nresult is critical from a quality assurance point of view since the undetected tow gaps can compromise\nmechanical performance in aerospace components. The true negative rate of 55% indicates that more than half of the defect-free regions are correctly\nclassified, while the false positive rate of 45% reflects a conservative detection strategy that is biased\ntoward defect sensitivity. This trade-off is expected in safety-critical inspection systems, where one\ngenerallyprefersfalsealarmsovermisseddefects.

Manufacturers can construct lightweight, mechanically sound structures with intricate\ngeometries thanks to AFP’s ability to precisely place composite tows along predetermined paths. Despite all of the benefits, AFP is vulnerable to manufacturing flaws caused by process variability,\nmaterial behavior, environmental factors, and machine errors. The most prevalent of these flaws are\ntow-gaps, overlaps, wrinkles, twists, and bridging. Because they directly lower the local fiber volume\nfraction, tow gaps are among the worst, because they result in stress concentrations and decreased\nmechanical performance. The substantial impact of tow-gaps on the structural integrity of composite laminates has been\nshowninanumberofstudies. AccordingtoGuinetal. (2018),laminatesmanufacturedwithtow-gaps\nwith AFP have significantly lower compressive and tensile strengths and different failure mechanisms\nwhen loaded. Similarly to this, Ravangard et al. (2025) investigated the morphological effects of\nmanufacturing flaws and demonstrated that tow gaps lead to out-of-plane fiber waviness, which in\nturnreducesstrengthandstiffness. Theseresultshighlighttheneedforpreciseandreliableinspection\ntechniques to identify tow-gaps early in the manufacturing process. For AFP inspection, computer vision offers a number of benefits. It greatly lowers operator de-\npendency and the possibility of overlooked flaws by enabling real-time, inline monitoring throughout\nthe manufacturing process. According to Shadmehri et al.
